3. Convert operating trackers into decision-making discipline

## Top 3 Company Priorities (This Week)
1. **Generate qualified demand and first serious sales conversations**
2. **Publish trust + proof assets (product quality, reliability, execution capability)**
3. **Advance capital/protection track (grants, credit optimization, legal structuring prep)**

---
