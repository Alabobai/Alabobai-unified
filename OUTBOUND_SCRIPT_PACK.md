# Outbound Script Pack (Founder-Led)

## 1) Cold DM / LinkedIn (short)
Hey {{Name}} — I’m building Alabobai, an AI execution OS for non-technical founders.

We help teams move from idea → launch assets → outreach workflow in days, not months.

If useful, I can share a 1-page pilot outline tailored to {{Company}}.

## 2) Email (direct)
Subject: Quick idea for {{Company}}’s execution speed

Hi {{Name}},

I’m Abdou, founder of Alabobai.
We help non-technical teams run faster with an AI execution layer across brand, GTM, and operating workflows.

I think we can help {{Company}} achieve {{specific plausible outcome}} within a short pilot.

If open, I can send a 1-page pilot plan with scope, timeline, and success metrics.

Best,
Abdou

## 3) Follow-up (value-add)
Wanted to follow up with one concrete thought for {{Company}}:
- Current bottleneck: {{observed bottleneck}}
- Fast fix: {{specific pilot action}}
- Expected impact: {{metric impact}}

If useful, I can map this into a 14-day pilot plan.

## 4) Discovery Call opener (30 sec)
Thanks for taking time.
Goal today: understand your current execution bottlenecks, confirm where AI leverage makes the biggest impact, and decide whether a short pilot is worth running.

## 5) Discovery questions (high-signal)
1. What’s your #1 growth bottleneck right now?
2. Where do projects stall (strategy, assets, execution, follow-through)?
3. What outcome in 30 days would make this a clear win?
4. What systems/tools are currently fragmented?
5. Who decides and how fast can you start a pilot?

## 6) Close on call
Based on this, I recommend a focused pilot:
- Scope: {{scope}}
- Timeline: {{timeline}}
- Success metrics: {{metrics}}
- Next step: kickoff this week
