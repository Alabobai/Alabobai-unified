# Week 1 Execution Plan — Alabobai

## Week Objective
Establish the operating cadence and ship measurable progress across:
1. Product trust (production readiness + UX quality)
2. Market narrative (brand + positioning)
3. Revenue engine setup (pipeline + outreach foundations)
4. Protection engine setup (finance/legal/grants/credit trackers)

---

## Top 3 Company Priorities (This Week)
1. **Lock wedge positioning + external messaging**
2. **Finalize launch-ready trust baseline** (reliability/security/UI scorecards in place)
3. **Stand up revenue + capital operating system** (pipeline, grants, credit, finance dashboards)

---

## Monday Dashboard (Pre-Filled)
- Week of: 2026-02-16

### Scorecard Snapshot (starting baseline)
- North Star (% first business outcome in 7 days): **Baseline to instrument this week**
- Revenue: **Pipeline framework setup**
- Growth: **Positioning + content engine kickoff**
- Product: **Premium UI pass complete; release checklist in place**
- Reliability: **Build passing; readiness/health routes in place**
- Capital/Grants: **Grant pipeline setup pending**
- Credit: **Personal/business utilization baseline pending**
- Legal/Risk: **Entity/trust prep packet pending**

### Biggest Risks (Top 3)
1. Strategy spread too wide (too many ICPs at once)
2. Distribution lag despite strong product progress
3. Legal/finance infrastructure not maturing as fast as GTM ambition

### Friday Success Criteria
- [ ] Wedge ICP and 1-line category statement finalized
- [ ] Release scorecard run and documented with pass/fail evidence
- [ ] First outbound + partner + grant + credit trackers active
